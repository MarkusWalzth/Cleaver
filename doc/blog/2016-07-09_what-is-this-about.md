# What is this about!

Of course a more telling README will be added in the (hopeful near) future. For
now this blog entry must suffice.

`cleaver` will be my personal *toy* compiler, through its development I hope to
gain a better grip of Rust --- as well as a better understanding about the
internals of a (modern) compiler.

## Why Rust?

Learning new languages seems to be worth it all the time, even if you do not
end up using it. Features presented on a silver platter in one language can
quite often be translated over to another (maybe more common one) to enhance
your overall experience.

Rust's popularity has been growing rapidly over the past months and looking at
all those project, it looks like it will stay around for some time --- similar
Go. The concept of guaranteed memory safety by using techniques like lifetimes,
ownership and borrowing look promising to me.

I have also been using Haskell over the past 6 months or so and really like the
elegance of pure functional programming. Perhaps some of these newly acquired
skills can be applied here.

## Why a Compiler?

The aim is not to build a production ready compiler for a *real* programming
language. The main goal here is to implemented old and modern, as well as
experimental concepts and techniques typically found in compilers. This is
mainly for personal education and research.

The input language will be very simplistic and will change over time to make
certain steps inside the compiler easier. Again this is about the compiler not
designing a great programming language.

## Why call it `cleaver`?

While Rust's name original comes from the *rust family of fungi*, people often
associate it with iron oxide. And since this project is not recommended for
production but for research, education and entertainment it should resemble a
*tool*, but one you don't usually keep in your toolbox.

So why would anyone carry around a rusty cleaver in one's toolbox?
